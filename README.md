# Crunchy-Spin

A mock website of CrunchyRoll merchandising website used to showcase backend and front end capabilities.

## Packages used
React, Mongoose, Express, method-override

## Tech 
JavaScript, Css, React

## How It Works
The website is to function like any regular store. However it is very minimalistic and there is of course nothing to purchase. This is purely to show off linking 
webpages together, and connecting to an online database to represent the inventory of items you can buy. The store has a nav menu that seconds as a header,
products, a page that will load once clicking on a particular product, and a thank you for purchasing page.

Some other functionalities are also you are able to add a product in the bottom left of the 'All Products' page, as well as when clicked on a product you are able
to edit properties of the product that is directly updated to the database once submitted. As well as a 'Purchase button that will decrement the stock of the 
selected product by 1 once purchased. 

Lastly there is also a footer that has been added with some links to my linkedin and github.

## Information 
This project from PerScholas software engineering bootcamp was created to be able to show off skills learned in class connecting back end elements of a web page into
one cohesive page. Mongo DB was used to simulate an inventory for an online store that was to be updated inside the website.  Express allowed us to be able to 
link other elements together to create a seamless webpage that transitions from page to page using elements on the website (buttons, links, images).

The front end of the site was generated using React components where we are generating html pages through react, connecting variables from our database onto the react page, and linking the pages together using Express and loading the styling of the page using a Default Layout react page that links to CSS. 

## Future Updates

Categorizing the different products and adding said products to the options on the nav bar.

Login function that will store user logins in a database and provide discounted prices for members.

A recently viewed items page that will store the users recently viewed items when viewing a particular product.
